TOP learning course 1st project

In this project Terms of Reference was create a simple website which include main page with Header h1 "Odin Recipes" and navigation with 3 links.

Every link follows to another html page with recipe of some dish. Every recipe page must have back link.

For every page i used own h1 header, because its separated pages, but not a javascript changeble content in single page.

Also i used structure ul>li for similar content and add additional back link after content for better usability.
